### Covid-19's effect on the stock market

Step A - About the problem

Covid-19, which emerged in early 2020, undoubtedly made its impact felt in many areas. Undoubtedly, the stock markets
of the countries affected the most in this process. Since the outbreak of the disease, there has been a huge decline 
in the stock markets, and with this decline, most companies have pulled the flag of bankruptcy. Also, it wasn't just 
companies that were affected. Most investors around the world have suffered enormous losses with this decline. 
Of course, these decreases and losses did not last long because, although the pandemic affected the stock markets and 
investors negatively, the economic aid packages provided by the states to their citizens in the following process paved 
the way for the stock markets to rise rapidly and it even set new records. As a result, covid-19 has affected the stock 
markets both well and badly. In this study, we will examine its good and bad sides based on visual and numerical data.

Step B - Extra Details:

Data Gathering

I found this data from websites that write news and articles about the economy and stock markets around the world. All 
the data I have received are based on highly accurate and comprehensive research. With this data I received, I clearly
understood how covid-19 affected the stock market.

Challanges

While collecting data, I encountered 2 main difficulties. First, there are a lot of written news and articles on the
Internet, but I was not sure of their accuracy. There were many articles and news I found, but I had a hard time 
eliminating unnecessary ones among them. Second, since there are many stock market in the world, it took me a 
while to examine them one by one, but I gained important information.

I have collected almost 10-15 data sources now, but as my research continues, this number may increase in the future. 
I will share the data according to the course of the project.
