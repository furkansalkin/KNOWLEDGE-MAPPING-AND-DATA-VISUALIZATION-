### Covid-19's effect on the stock market
Covid-19, which emerged in early 2020, undoubtedly made its impact felt in many areas. Undoubtedly, the stock markets
of the countries affected the most in this process. Since the outbreak of the disease, there has been a huge decline 
in the stock markets, and with this decline, most companies have pulled the flag of bankruptcy. Also, it wasn't just 
companies that were affected. Most investors around the world have suffered enormous losses with this decline. 
Of course, these decreases and losses did not last long because, although the pandemic affected the stock markets and 
investors negatively, the economic aid packages provided by the states to their citizens in the following process paved 
the way for the stock markets to rise rapidly and it even set new records. As a result, covid-19 has affected the stock 
markets both well and badly. In this study, we will examine its good and bad sides based on visual and numerical data.
